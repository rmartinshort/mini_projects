# mini_projects

#### These are a selection of small projects, mainly as Jupyter notebooks, which developed out of my reading or general interest. Most are in a state of semi-completion, but they are useful reference when I need to recall tools and ideas.   

 - Elevator: Class to simulate an elevator. Give it a list of instructions (e.g. the floors at which people want to enter and their destinations).    

- Load_curve _example: Predicting a timeseries of power consumption from environmental factors such as time and temperature    

- Titanic_kaggle: Classification experiments with the titanic survival prediction problem   

- Types of histograms: Plotting an earthquake backazimuth distribution 

- Earthquake_clustering: Attempt to use clustering algorithms to identify similar earthquakes. Didn't really work  

- Flight_delays: Classification problem attempting to predict if a flight will be delayed. From a kaggle dataset. 

- kaggle_home_credit_default: Outlier detection problem - attempt to predict if a customer will default on a loan from various features   
- land_cover_prediction: Classification problem to determine land cover type from field observations. From a UCI dataset     

- sqlzoo: Solutions to exercises from SQLZOO.org    

- population_dynamics: Dynamic linear systems investigation; projecting population distribution into the future    

- Baysian experiments: From reading 'Data Analysis, a Baysian Tutorial'   

- Mapping tools: Some experiments with overlaying geopandas plots on satellite data and folium heatmaps 

- sklearn wine: Classification of wines using ANNs from tensorflow and keras, plus some other classifiers√ü
